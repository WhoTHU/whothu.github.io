I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, where I have been pursuing my degree since 2017 under the guidance of Prof. Bo Zhang and Prof. Xiaolin Hu. My current research interests mainly focused on the adversarial examples and the privacy risks of deep learning models. Additionally, my research experience includes visual classification, visual detection, point-cloud detection, federated learning, and 3D modeling.
