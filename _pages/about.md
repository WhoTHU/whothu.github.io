<hr />

I am a postdoc in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. David Wagner](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~daw/). I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2023, advised by [Prof. Bo Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4006.htm) and [Prof. Xiaolin Hu](http://xlhu.cn/). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2017. My current research interest primarily includes adversarial examples and privacy in deep learning, especially in Computer Vision (CV) and Large Language Models (LLMs). My goal is to contribute to the development of reliable and trustworthy AI systems by identifying and tackling anomalous behavior in deep learning models.
