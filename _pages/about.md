<hr />

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Bo Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4006.htm) and [Prof. Xiaolin Hu](http://xlhu.cn/). I am a member of [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), which is directed by [Prof. Bo Zhang](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1059/4006.htm) and [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml). I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2017. My current research interest primarily includes adversarial examples and privacy in deep learning models. My goal is to contribute to the development of reliable and trustworthy AI systems by identifying and tackling anomalous behavior in deep learning models.
